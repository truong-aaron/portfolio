        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Nutripair endeavors to empower individuals with tools that identify the best food options tailored to their specific needs while aiding local restaurants in bolstering revenue streams and appealing to a diverse clientele.</p>
        <p>Since May, I have been leading the design team and currently oversee the mobile application's development from ideation to implementation.</p>

        <h4>Website Overhaul</h4>
            <p>My first project was to redesign the website in preparation for closed alpha testing. The goal was to modernize its aesthetic and provide CTAs that would allow interested parties to join the alpha tests.</p>
            <p>I collaborated extensively with the CEO and tech leads to develop a comprehensive redesign that incorporated their feedback along with findings from my analysis of the original siteâ€™s pain points and areas for improvement.</p>

        <h4>Findings from Alpha Testing</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>A major problem</h3>
            <p>I joined the design team following the completion of the alpha prototype. Consequently, my focus at the time was centered around conducting usability testing with user groups, remotely over Zoom.</p>
            <p>These sessions proved instrumental in pinpointing pain points and gathering feedback. However, they also revealed a prevalent issue unanimously expressed by our users:</p>
            <article style="background-color:#F8DCD6;">
                <p><b>&#10071 The Nutripair app was suffering from a lack of functionality.</b></p>
                <p><b>It needed additional features and streamlined user flows to offer a more enriching experience beyond basic nutritional data presentation.</b></p>
                <p><b>Presently, its appeal to both users and prospective restaurant partners is limited because of its underwhelming state.</b></p></article>
        <br>
        <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
            <p>To address this challenge, we framed some guiding questions to keep us focused:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><i>Who will be our main users? What would motivate them to use Nutripair?</i></li>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><i>What features and content do our users want to see in the app?</i></li>
                <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><i>What benefits will the app offer restaurants to encourage them to partner with us?</i></li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>Following the alpha testing phase, Nutripair experienced a restructuring within the design team, resulting in the departure of the team lead. </p>
            <p>Subsequently, I assumed the responsibility of reconstructing the team and spearheading the redesign of the mobile app.</p>

    <h4>Research & Discovery</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Identifying Users</h3>
        <p>We conducted interviews with users who participated in our alpha testing and organized focus group discussions to gain deeper insights into their motivations for using the Nutripair app and desired functionalities.</p>
        <p>This process enabled us to highlight differences and similarities among our users and to identify their specific needs, pain points, and motivations.</p>
        <P>We crafted personas and corresponding user flows, providing a structured framework to extract design opportunities.</p>
    <h3>Analyzing Competitors</h3>
        <p>The team conducted an in-depth examination of mobile apps with similar user flows and features.</p>
        <p>While analyzing these apps, we asked ourselves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><i>How do these apps effectively cater to their user bases?</i></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><i>What distinguishes Nutripair from its counterparts?</i></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><i>How do users engage with these apps, and what would a typical user flow look like?</i></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><i>Are there areas that could be improved upon?</i></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Rather than just presenting users with nutritional data, these apps also provide experiences where users can explore new cuisines, discover local eateries, and personalize their choices.</p>
        <article style="background-color:#D7FBC1">
            <b>&#128161 Nutripair needed to provide more engaging ways for our users to interact with the entire dining experience, moving beyond merely displaying nutritional labels.</b>
        </article>
    <h3>Workshops</h3>
        <p>At this stage, we had pinpointed many key features for the app. To streamline our focus and ensure a manageable workload, we organized multiple workshops and card-sorting sessions.</p>
        <p>These sessions, spearheaded by the design team and myself, involved extensive collaboration with developers and the CEO where we would have everyone rank features based on desirability to users, feasibility, and potential impact on the overall user experience.</p>
        <p>The objective was to align everyone's understanding regarding feature prioritization, the product roadmap, and the overarching vision for Nutripair.</p>
    <h3>Goals to keep in mind</h3>
        <p>Through our discovery and research efforts, we not only identified which features to implement & prioritize but also the fundamental principles that will define the Nutripair experience.</p>
