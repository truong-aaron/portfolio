		<h2 class="ecotexttitle"><i>NEEDFINDING</i></h2>
		 <br><br>
		
		<p class="ecotext">Through interviews with students on campus, our group identified that the majority of young adults want to be more environmentally conscious. However, we noticed <span class="bold">three recurring issues:</span></p><br>

		<ol class="ecotext">
			<span class="bold"><li><b>Many don’t understand how their efforts are making a difference</b></li><br>
			<li><b>It’s confusing for them to understand how impactful daily tasks are, such as commuting by bike instead of driving</b></li><br>
			<li><b>Many simply don’t know how to be more environmentally conscious</b></li> </span>
		
		</ol><br>
		<p class="ecotext">With these in mind, our team audited existing emission trackers. We recognized that many were simply calculators that weren’t efficient for daily use and did little to motivate an eco-concious lifestyle.</p> <br>
		<p class="ecotext">Most of the existing “solutions” mainly provided rough annual estimates of total carbon emissions, which is too arbitrary for most users to conceptualize their impact.</p><br>
	</div>
		
	<img src="images/ecotracker/need.png" style="width:50%; margin-left:25%;"> <br>

		<center><p class = "ecotextmini">ex. This calculator from the EPA doesn’t afford daily tracking and <br>visualization of impact beyond the metrics of CO2/year.</p> </center><br><br>


	<!------------------- the problem ---------------->
	<div class="whitespace"></div>
	
	<div class="container">
	<div class="col-lg-10">
		<h2 class="ecotexttitle"><i>THE PROBLEM</i></h2>
		 <br><br>

		<p class="ecotext">From these audits and interviews findings, we recognized that <span class="bold">current</span> solutions and trackers weren’t working because their results <span class="bold">were difficult to fully conceptualize and easily track</span> varied tasks that differ day-to-day.</p> <br>

		<p class="ecotext">Additionally, <span class="bold">maintaining motivation while seeing no tangible results is difficult</span>> for any goal, but even more so with huge goals such as saving the Earth.</p><br>

		<p class="ecotext"><span class="bold">Users need a dynamic and understandable tracker that keeps up with their daily, everchanging lives.</span></p>
		</div>

 	<!------------------- storyboard ------------------->
		<div class="whitespace"></div>
		
		<div class="container">
		<div class="col-lg-10">
		<h2 class="ecotexttitle"><i>STORYBOARD</i></h2>
		 <br><br>

			<p class="ecotext"> To get a better understanding of how Eco-tracker could solve these problems, our team storyboarded daily scenarios where our app provided users ease in dynamic tracking and comprehending results in an everyday scenario.</p><br><br> 

			<img src="images/ecotracker/storyboard.png" style="width: 70%; margin-left:25%;">
		

			<center><p class="ecotextmini" style="margin-left: 20%;">This example also highlights how many folks who want to be more enviromentally friendly<br> can lose their motivation, simply because they have no idea if their efforts make an<br> impact–which Eco-track aims to fix!</p> <br></center>
		
			<p class="ecotext">Creating storyboards helped our team synthesize our previous research and findings to envision scenarios of Eco-tracker’s dynamic use & how it would address the opportunities from our needfinding.</p>

		<!------------------- wireframe ---------------->
		<div class="whitespace"></div>
		<div class="container">
		<div class="col-lg-10">
		<h2 class="ecotexttitle"><i>WIREFRAME + PROTOTYPE</i></h2>
		 <br><br>

			<p class="ecotext">With an understanding of Eco-tracker’s design opportunities, our group began iterating with two paper prototypes that focused on different main functionalities.</p><br><br>

			<img src="images/ecotracker/paper1.png" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 20%;">
			<center><p class="ecotextmini" style="margin-left: 20%;"> Prototype 1</p> <br><br> </center>
			
			<p class="ecotext">For prototype 1, the main functionality is for the users to <span class="bold">add goals and reminders </span>that will help them be more eco-friendly.<br><br>The main user flow for this prototype is for the user to easily set goals, track emissions, and work towards accomplishing those goals.</p><br><br>

			<img src="images/ecotracker/paper2.png" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 20%;">
			<center><p class="ecotextmini" style="margin-left: 20%;"> Prototype 2</p></center> <br><br> 

			<p class="ecotext">For this second prototype, the <span class="bold">emphasis is focused more towards </span>tracking in general with the optional use of setting goals. As such, compared to the other design, this flow is centered around a home page that displays the daily emissions statistics.</p><br>

			<p class="ecotext">From our research, users’<span class="bold"> primary goals</span> were to <span class="bold">easily track</span> and <span class="bold">understand</span> their environmental <span class="bold">impact in a tangible manner.</span> </p>

			<p class="ecotext">Goals were nice to have, but having them as the focus didn’t address the core user needs. They wanted to visualize and understand that what they were doing was producing tangible results.</p>

			<p class="ecotext">As a result, <span class="bold">Prototype 2</span> was the one <span class="bold">chosen</span> to be further refined into a mid-fidelity wireframe (see below) as its statistics focused home page would best supported users in developing eco-friendly habits and address the opportunites discovered from our needfinding.</p><br>

			<img src="images/ecotracker/wireframe.png" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 25%;"><br><br>

			<p class="ecotext">This design addressed the opportunities found in our needfinding by providing digestible data from users logged activities. It visualizes the impact that users have daily/monthly in categories so that they can easily ecognize it and make changes.</p>

		<!-----------------User testing------------------>

		<div class="whitespace"></div>
			<div class="container">
		<div class="col-lg-10">
		<h2 class="ecotexttitle"><i>USER TESTING</i></h2>
		 <br><br>

			<p class="ecotext">For our initial round of testing, four random users from our main demographic (young, eco-conscious adults) participated. They were given a list of tasks to accomplish as we observered for any potential painpoints or issues.<br><br>The tests were conducted via mobile browsers, accessing our application that was hosted on Heroku.</p><br>

			<img src="images/ecotracker/testing.png" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 38%;"> <br><br>

			<p class="ecotext">Testing with a functional mobile prototype instead of laptops with Figma provided key insights into how we needed to adjust parts of our design to be mobile accessible.<br><br>Gestures that our team assumed were natural to do with a cursor didn’t always translate to productive results once we began testing with mobile users.<br><br>In this instance (pictured), we found that our buttons, specifically a sliding bar, were misplaced which caused issues such as entire windows being dragged.</p><br><br>

			<br><p class="ecotext"><span class="bold">Results from the testing were far from perfect. There were three main issues that our testers all experienced:</span></p><br>

			<p class="ecotext">
				<ol class="ecotext">
					<li>Users couldn’t understand the signifiers used, such as the summary page and log icons on the navbar.</li><br>
					<li>Data figures on the summary page were too ambiguous and unmotivating to users, such as “L” for liters of carbon. Users additionally felt anxiety at how much they were wasting rather than saving.</li><br>
					<li>Users were confused whenever they were confronted with errors due to buggy interactions and couldn’t recover from them.</li></ol></p><br><br>

	<!-----------------FINAL PROTOYYPE---------------->

		<div class="whitespace"></div>
		<div class="container">
		<div class="col-lg-10">
		<h2 class="ecotexttitle"><i>FINAL PROTOTYPE</i></h2>
		 <br><br>

			<p class="ecotext">In our final prototype, our team worked to address the issues brought up from our user testing sessions surrounding unclear signifiers, ambigious data presentation, & buggy interactions.</p><br>

			<img src="images/ecotracker/test1.png" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 28%;"> <br><br><br>

			<p class="ecotext">To resolve the majority of issues brought up from testing, our group focused the redesign on the home page, logging interactions, and menu bar.<br><br></p>

			<p class="ecotext"><span class="bold"><u>Signifier (navbar) updates:</u></span> 
				<ul class="ecotext">
					<li>Summary icon has been updated to one more representative of its affordances</li>
					<li>Removed unnecessary “Profile” tab from menu bar as a social network function was out of scope for the project</li>
					<li>“Plus” icon was made larger and centered to increase ease of access to the main functionality of tracking</li></ul><br><br></p>

			<p class="ecotext"><span class="bold"><u>Clarified data:</u></span>
				<ul class="ecotext">
					<li>Changed the ambiguous  “L” unit to “lbs of CO2”, a more common unit of measurement that users are accustomed to</li></ul><br><br></p>
			
			<p class="ecotext"><span class="bold"><u>Increasing motivation:</u></span>
			<ul class="ecotext">
					<li>Added modules that helped visualized users’ impacts in terms of positive environmental impacts such as “trees saved”, shifting tracking focus from carbon wasted to instead positive gains from habit changes.</li></ul><br><br></p>

			<img src="images/ecotracker/test2.png" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 30%;"> <br><br><br>

			<p class="ecotext"><span class="bold"><u>Easier logging</u></span> Users are able to input their exact mileage with a pop-up numpad rather than fidgeting with a slider that doesn’t offer as much control.</p>

		<h2 class="ecotexttitle"><i>VALIDATING CHANGES</i></h2>
		 <br><br>

			<p class="ecotext">To validate if our new changes were effective, we <span class="bold">conducted A/B testing with a large sample of 152 users.</span>The participants were randomly assigned either the old or updated versions.</p><br>

			<p class="ecotext">In order to measure the effectiveness of our changes, we tracked how many users were able to successfully log miles travelled & how long it took them do so using Google Analytics.</p><br><br>
			
			<img src="images/ecotracker/vali1.png" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 25%"> <br><br>

			<p class="ecotext">Of 115 successful task completions, the <span class="bold">updated version</span> (/viewAlt) had a <span class="bold">higher rate of success</span> of 20% more <span class="bold">than the original</span> (/commute).<br><br></p>

			<img src="images/ecotracker/vali2.png" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 25%;"> <br><br> 

			<p class="ecotext">Additionally, (/viewAlt) was also quicker on average to complete than (/commute) by almost 20 seconds!.</p><br>

			<p class="ecotext">In summary, the results validated our updates as there was a statiscally higher and faster completion rate of the task than the original version.</p><br>

			<p class="ecotext">And that’s how we created Eco-tracker! From paper protoypes, wireframes, & Figma mockups, our team then produced a coded version of Eco-tracker that you can actually click through!</p><br>

			<p class="ecotext">Given more time & resources, I would love to revisit other features like Goals and increase testing for our other logging methods. However, I am proud of my teams’ accomplishments in designing, testing, and coding Eco-tracker in 9 weeks.</p><br>

			<p class="ecotext">Not only did I gain experience in design, but also new found appreciation for developers who bring designs to life and compromises to make to translate mockups to functioning applications in a short timeline.</p><br>
