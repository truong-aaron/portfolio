				<p class="ecotext">For the latest design sprint, my team was <span class="bold">tasked with prototyping redesigns and improvements for the Follow app</span> to better suit user needs.<br><br>
					We were given a “How might we” statement to guide our team as we began conducting preliminary research with users to indentify what a new version of Follow should contain.<br><br>
					Given the broadness of our prompt, needfinding was to be conducted to narrow down what should be focused on within the sprint’s scope.

							<li>Identifying cause of negative reviews, ”Is it something design can solve or is it technical?”</li>
						</ul>

					<li><span class="bold">Interviews with 20 users of the Follow app</span></li>
