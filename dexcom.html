				<p class="text">For the latest design sprint, my team was <b>tasked with prototyping redesigns and improvements for the Follow app</b> to better suit user needs.<br><br>
					We were given a “How might we” statement to guide our team as we began conducting preliminary research with users to indentify what a new version of Follow should contain.<br><br>
					Given the broadness of our prompt, needfinding was to be conducted to narrow down what should be focused on within the sprint’s scope.

					<li><b>Comparative analysis of competitors’ CGM apps</b></li>
						<ul class="text">
							<li>“What functionality does Follow have/doesn’t have compared to others?”</li>

					<ul class="text">
							<li>Categorizing reviews based on similar sentiments</li>
							<li>Identifying cause of negative reviews, ”Is it something design can solve or is it technical?”</li>
						</ul>
					<li><b>Interviews with 20 users of the Follow app</b></li>

							<li>Walk us through their typical flow</li>
							<li>Taking note of recurring points/needs users bring up</li>

				<p class="text">The results were then compiled into affinity maps to identify potential opportunity points to prioritize for this sprint.
					<br><br>
					We <b>pinpointed three main design opportunities</b> for the new version of Follow that would address the most common needs and concerns that users experienced.

					<div class="whitespace"></div>
						<p class="text">Since this was during the height of the pandemic, our team had to conduct everything remotely, including prototyping. As such, our primary tools were Figma, Zoom, and digital sketching to maximize collaboration and input.</p><br>

					<img src="images/dexcom/testing.png" style="width: 65%;"> <br><br>
					<p class="text">Without getting into specifics, we had frequent testing sessions as we iterated, which were invaluable! It helped validate and inform further design modifications as we continued developing the prototypes.</p><br>
					<p class="text">By testing with current users of Follow app, we got a better sense of how important it was in their daily lives. As such, their insightful painpoints and needs guided further development changes.</p>

						<br><br>
						<img src="images/dexcom/deliverable.png" style="width: 50%;"><br><br><br>
						<p class="text">The proposals and prototypes were further divided into different levels of priority for implementation based on their importance to users, validated by our research and test findings.</p>
						<br>
						<p class="text">Our concepts well received and given great feedback from the Dexcom design team (which you can read more about <a href="https://ddi-simple.webflow.io/">here.) Our test users were also estatic that their needs, for such an essential tool in their lives, were finally being addressed!</a></p>

				<p class="text">After three wonderful design sprints with DDI and the Dexcom team, I have learned a great deal about working with industry professionals, remote research/testing, and presenting my work to stakeholders.<br><br>

				Thank-you once again to my fellow DDI teammates, mentors, and the Dexcom Follow team for such an educating experience and opportunity.<br><br>

				While I was unable to disclose much about my work, I am able to talk more about what I have learned, experienced, and developed from this internship.<b> So, feel free to ask me more questions!</b></p>
